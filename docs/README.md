# Px.Utils

Px.Utils is a .NET library for reading and processing px files and processing data in px-type cube format. The goal of this library is to offer a high performance and easy to use library that can be integrated into any .NET project. This project aims to follow these core design principles:

### High performance
Everything is designed with performance in mind. Px files are commonly used in webserver environments where performance and low memory usage is important.
### Be as unopinionated as possible
We do not want to limit the user if not absolutely necessary. There are variations in the metadata between users and we want to support as many as possible.
### High modularity
Extending the library with a new features should be as easy as possible and every module should be useable on its own.
